      <description>Colleagues, friends, acquaintances, television personalities, and random people on the street often ask me &amp;ldquo;What is your deal with simulated method of moments?&amp;rdquo; So, instead of just making a face like I&amp;rsquo;ve just drunk spoiled milk when I get to the end of a promising abstract and read the phrase &amp;ldquo;We estimate the model using the simulated method of moments&amp;rdquo; like I usually do, I figure it would be worthwhile to lay out some more coherent thoughts, with some simple strawman examples, of why I find most analyses using the simulated method of moments (along with related methods like indirect inference1) to be unreliable tools for learning anything useful about the economy.</description>
